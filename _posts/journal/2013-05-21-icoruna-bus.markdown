I decided to share this old project that I found in my computer. It was published in the App Store two years ago and it reached almost 10k downloads in the few months it was alive. It got some attention in the media, and I even came to the radio [for an interview](http://busurbano.blogspot.com.es/2011/01/la-aplicacion-icoruna-el-bus-urbano-en.html). Absolutely worth it and fun, but it’s a pity I didn’t have time to maintain the project.
