I did it again. My very first mobile app was [a bus app](http://adrian.otero.ws/2013/05/icoruna-bus.html) for iOS. Now that I switched to Android and I moved to another city, it was about time to make a new one. And [Portland Bus](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ws.otero.adrian.portlandbus) is the result.

It's still in beta, but it works just fine. There are two main reasons why I've developed an app like this:

- I needed it. Notifications are a must have nowadays and there was no app with them for Portland.
- I really want to do things with Android. I had a little bit of experience but working on this app let me learn a lot of things. I'm here to stay, and expect posts about Android development from now on.
