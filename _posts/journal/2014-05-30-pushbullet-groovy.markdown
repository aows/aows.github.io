I'd forgotten, but about a month ago I implemented this simple Groovy script to send a notification using Pushbullet API: [https://gist.github.com/aows/91aff80e03c95104d06c﻿](https://gist.github.com/aows/91aff80e03c95104d06c﻿)

**Update** Oh well, just realized they've released [a new API](http://blog.pushbullet.com/2014/05/15/a-new-and-much-more-powerful-api/) two weeks ago. The script should still work fine though.﻿
