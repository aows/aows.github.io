Little by little, Google Now came from being a cool app to be the most important app to me. I use it every day, and now and then it still surprises me with things I was not expecting but make a lot of sense. Still, there is a lot of work to do here and a lot of room to improve it. These are some of my suggestions.

##Improve (a lot) "time to work" and "time to home"

Google Now should allow you to customize your commute route. For instance, I walk to a bus stop, I take a bus there, get off and then walk again for 15 minutes to the office. Google suggests me to take another bus, but I don't want to because it's not convenient. I just can't change that, and all the estimated times are wrong and useless.

Also, why do I have to choose a preferred way to commute? I would ride my bike if it was sunny, another days I will take the bus. Show me both options. Even better, if it's raining, just show me the public transit one.

## Show me cards from another apps (aka it needs an API)
So Google Now reads your email and shows you things you've bought, reservations and so on. That's cool, but I also want to be able to get cards from apps I use the most. The first one to come to my mind is Mint. I wish I could see on my Google Now my account numbers every morning without having to open the app. Or have the bus tickets ready to show without needing to search and open that app. Articles from Pocket I could read during my commute (you know I'm on the bus) or at nights. Messages I didn't answer. The last photo I got on WhatsApp. Warn me if I didn't set an alarm for tomorrow. Tell me how many visits I had to my website the day before. There are so many possibilities.

Most of these could be done with widgets... but no. I can discard a Google Now card and it will show up again tomorrow. That doesn't happen with widgets. Always there!

## Suggest me new friends on G+
Maybe not a Google Now feature, but wouldn't it be cool that if I'm going to the same place over and over and someone else is doing the same, Google suggested us to connect on G+? For instance, I'm taking English classes. Like me, 4 more people. Google knows those 5 people are in the same location for 2 hours every Thursday. Come on. You know we know each other. I don't need to send them an email or have their phone numbers to get the suggestion.

## Inferred events
Ok, this feature [might be coming soon to Google Now](http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/03/21/rumor-with-inferred-events-google-now-will-find-possible-events-in-google-apps-ask-to-create-calendar-entries-apk-teardown/). But I want it to go further. Don't suggest me an event only if someone types a date and a time on Hangouts or an email. The same way GMail can tell you you are forgetting an attachment because you wrote it, it should be able to detect things like "sounds good, I'll do it tonight" and set a reminder.

## Shortcuts to apps based on context
You know where I take the bus everyday. So when I'm there, show me the app I always open to track the buses and show my tickets (thought this wouldn't be necessary if I could have cards from another apps as I mentioned before). If I have my earphones connected, show me the apps I usually open (to listen to podcasts, music, whatever). Also, based on time. If I'm at home at night, suggest me Netflix. If I'm outside, suggest me Yelp, Shazam or a cab app.

## Show me new interesting & personalized content, not only feeds updates
I love Twitter. Yes, I use FB. I'd love to do the same with G+. But I don't usually have time to spend going through all these social networks looking for something interesting. Please, bring me updates from my friends or things I like (my soccer team, my NBA team, my mom, my best friend, my girlfriend...) and those popular ones on these networks.

Twitter shouldn't be a following thing. It should be a "things I like" network, showing me new content from those sources I'm interested in. If I read an article, Google know I'm interested in that topic. Show me more. I don't want to scan through all tweets to find 2 or 3 I will really like. I only follow around 150 accounts on Twitter and I don't have time to process all of them. I feel I'm wasting my time. And Google Now could help with this. Every morning or every night, show me what happened the day before or during that day based on what I read or liked in the past.

It should join all networks so I don't know if the content is coming from FB, Twitter, G+ or wherever. It's not that I don't know it, it's that I don't care.

Now, Google Now is showing me new articles from websites I usually visit. Good, but I had Google Reader for that, and it was better. Don't be yet another feed reader. Search through all my likes (RT, likes on Google+, the music I listen to on Google Play Music, articles I read on my computer, links I send to friends...) and show me just a selection of those. If I want more, I can open Twitter, FB or whatever. But I don't always want to. Be smarter!ï»¿
